This is a website I built in Dec. 2025 for my Comp Sci 101 class. It is multi-page and includes graphics, lists, links, and public access. 

My site is live at https://clhollis.github.io/Courtney_and_Justin_Show/

Thank you to:

 - HTML5up (https://html5up.net/) for providing the free HTML template.
