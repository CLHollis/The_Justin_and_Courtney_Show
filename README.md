# The Justin and Courtney Show WEBSITE
This is a website I built in Dec. 2025 for my Comp Sci 101 class. It is multi-page and includes graphics, lists, links, and public access. 

My site is live at  http://tjacs.online/

Site Requirements:
 - A minimum of three pages
 - At least one image on the site
 - One unordered list
 - At least two external (off-site) links
 - Internal links to your other pages from your main page
 - Passes validation on the W3C validator page, which can be found at: http://validator.w3.org/

Thank you to:
 - IdeaSpot (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5AwNU3Y2es) for the tutorial on finding HTML templates, having Github host my website files, and (althought I opted out of this part...) creating a (not free) personalized custom domain name for my website.
 - LearnCode.academy You Tube Playlist: Web Development Tutorials for Beginners (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc) which includes the multi-page web design per my class requirements.
